       "    [Text(Lung disorders have significant morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, both in humans and in animals. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the leading causes of respiratory failure around the world. Although early diagnosis, timely medical care, and treatment may lead to improvement of symptoms, the signs return after a period of time. Causes of ARDS are different. It can be caused by direct or indirect damage to the lung epithelium. ARDS is described by severe hypoxemia, decreased pulmonary compliance, diffuse alveolar damage, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates after cardiac edema [),\n",

One particular feature of ARDS is lack of aerated lung volume caused by inflammation and edema, and total lung volume reduction (air + parenchyma) mostly in the lower lobes can explain hypoxemia, low respiratory compliance, and alveolar dead space and increased pulmonary vascular permeability [),\n",

       "     Text(]. CT scanning is a common clinical diagnostic tool, a specific, repeatable, and noninvasive technique for diagnosis that until now has rarely been used as a research tool, and there is not any valid data of the distribution region of the existence or absence of air in alveolus during ARDS and especially after cell-based therapy. Our findings based on CT scanning are matched with the diagnosis of pathology and all the other outcomes. Therefore, it can be said that CT scanning is a suitable method for evaluation of the stromal cell therapy effects in pulmonary inflammation and edema, but further studies are needed in this field. Interactions between lung, right ventricle, and pulmonary circulation are critical in ARDS. Serial echocardiographic measurements have a potential clinical diagnosis in the early stage ARDS as a prognostic and therapeutic method. We showed that ARDS causes changes in echocardiographic parameters and reduces cardiac function, whereas transplant of BM-MSCs was able to prevent these changes.)]),\n",

Although these studies could clear pathways, they are still far from tissue function. In this study, we tried to explain the MSCs’ effects on organ function. We investigated effects of BM-MSCs in an experimental model of ARDS and confirmed that MSCs decrease inflammation and improve alveolar fluid clearance and have a protective role in ARDS. Improvement in clinical signs, the decrease of inflammatory cells in blood and BAL, the balance in blood gases and cytokines, the decrease in the Hounsfield units, no changes in echocardiographic parameters. and the reduction of pulmonary hemorrhage and edema in pathology were observed. Despite these results, subsequent studies are required to confirm the decrease in inflammation, and physiological parameters over the long term and many experiments should be performed until stromal cell therapy is validated as a method of routine clinical treatment.)])]),\n",
