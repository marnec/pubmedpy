Seroprevalence was performed by ELISA based on P domain protein. CaNoVs were detected in dog fecal samples (14/459, 3.1%) and were phylogenetically classified into the same cluster as previously reported genogroup GIV CaNoVs.

Human NoVs are responsible for gastroenteritis in humans across all age groups, and typical symptoms of nausea, abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea can be demonstrated in an infected person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The fecal-oral route through contaminated food or water is the major pathway of the viral transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several characteristics of NoVs such as low infectious doses or high resistance to harsh environmental conditions facilitate the spread and infection of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">NoVs has been genetically classified into seven major genogroups designated GI through GVII based on sequence analysis of the VP1 protein (ORF2; major capsid protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

In humans, three genogroups GI, GII, and GIV are found, and GII strains are the most frequently detected. Additionally, bovine, porcine, and murine NoVs are classified in GIII, GII, and GV, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Canine norovirus (CaNoV) was first identified in a single dog with enteritis in Italy in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The detection of CaNoVs in fecal samples from dogs was followed in Portugal circa 2007, and then these viruses have been described in dogs from several countries in Europe and Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent prevalence study demonstrated that seropositivity for CaNoV was estimated to be 39% in dog serum samples from 14 different European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, it was suggested that CaNoV may infect humans, particularly veterinary workers with potential risk factors for virus exposure. Mesquita et al. reported that they tested serum samples collected from 373 small animal veterinarians and 120 controls in the general human population for the presence for CaNoV antibodies, and the seropositive rate of the veterinarian group was 22.3% compared to 5.8% in control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The emergence of CaNoVs may be a public health concern because pet animals are an integral part of family life in most industrialized countries, and their close relationship with humans needs to have special attention with potential reservoir of zoonotic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Unfortunately, the completeness of basic data associated with stool samples, including age, sex, breed, and any clinical history of enteric disease varied among the small animal clinics and animal shelters. This precludes further statistically valid analysis of the positive samples. The sequences of partial RdRp region of CaNoVs were analyzed with other CaNoVs sequences from the GenBank database (Fig.&#160;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="Fig1">1</xref>).

In South Korea, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation reported that companion animal market in South Korea is continuously expanding and is expected to grow at a significant pace in coming years. They forecast that the market will increase from 1 billion U.S. dollars in 2012 to 5.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Regardless of the increased exposure risk to humans with companion animals, there was no previous information concerning the epidemiology of CaNoV in the country. Although a markedly high detection rate of CaNoV in dogs was not demonstrated in the present study, this is the first study describing the detection and prevalence of CaNoV in dogs in South Korea and provides good baseline information for the design of further studies.</p><p id="Par17">CaNoVs detected in the present study were classified into the same cluster with previously reported genogroup GIV CaNoVs in the phylogenetic tree. It was expected that the CaNoV prevalence in fecal samples from the animal shelters would be relatively higher when compared to the samples from small animal clinics as environmental factors such as hygiene reasons or crowded space would be expected to increase transmission between dogs. However, there was no difference in the prevalence between these both dog populations. Seroprevalence of CaNoV was performed by ELISA based on P domain protein, and 15.9% of 427 dog serum samples collected from small animal clinics tested positive for IgG against genogroup GIV CaNoV. These results demonstrate that CaNoV has notably circulated in the dog population in South Korea.</p><p id="Par18">It was previously suggested that CaNoV can easily infect and spread within dog population and its homologous host, and viral characteristics such as incubation and shedding period of this virus resemble to human norovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Indeed, dogs contacted with imported dogs from Russia showed diarrhea and diagnosed with CaNoV infection in Portugal, even though the dogs had been vaccinated against major gastroenteritis pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

The antigenic activities between P domain proteins and VLPs were previously compared, and both antigens showed a similar binding effect and detectable affinity for norovirus specific antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].
